# Resume

*My resume*

### Overview
This is my personal resume. 

The resume is written in XML because I wanted a project to use as an exercise to explore XML and XSLT.

It is meant to be displayed as a webpage or as a PDF.  The [`nolan_resume.xslt`](nolan_resume.xslt) file transforms the XML into HTML and the [`nolan_resume.css`](nolan_resume.css) file styles that.

### To build and view:
- Open [`nolan_resume.xml`](nolan_resume.xml) in a web browser. (You may need to run a local webserver in order to have the styling applied correctly)
- `Ctl-p` and print as `.pdf`
