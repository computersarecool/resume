# Resume

*My resume*

### Overview
This is my resume. 

The resume data is written in XML because I wanted a project to use as an exercise to explore XML and XSLT.

It is meant to be displayed as a webpage or as a PDF.  

`nolan_resume.xslt` transforms the XML into HTML and `nolan_resume.css` styles that.

### To view the rendered resume:
- Use the link here: [`nolan_resume.xml`](https://cdn.rawgit.com/computersarecool/resume/master/nolan_resume.xml) and press `Ctl-p` to print / save as `.pdf`

### To view locally:
- Clone the repo and open `nolan_resume.xml` in a web browser. (You may need to run a local webserver in order to have the styling applied correctly)
- Press `Ctl-p` to print / save as `.pdf`
