# Resume
*My resume*

## Description
This repo contains my resume. It is meant to be displayed as a webpage or as a PDF.

## To view the rendered resume:
- Use the link here: [`nolan_resume.xml`](https://cdn.rawgit.com/computersarecool/resume/e2cb6dc5bdc651a674765b61d5633a924d2d529b/nolan_resume.xml) and press `Ctl-p` to print / save as `.pdf`

## To view the resume locally:
- Clone the repo and open `nolan_resume.xml` in a web browser. NOTE: You may need to run a local webserver in order to have the styling applied correctly
- Press `Ctl-p` to print / save as `.pdf`

## Project Structure
- `nolan_resume.xml` contains the raw resume data
- `nolan_resume.xslt` transforms the XML into HTML 
- `nolan_resume.css` styles that

## Extra Notes
I much prefer [other data formats](https://www.json.org/) but this is written in XML because I wanted a project to use as an exercise to explore XML and XSLT.
