# Resume

*My resume*

### Overview
This is my personal resume. 

The resume is written in XML because I wanted a project to use as an exercise to explore XML and XSLT.

It is meant to be displayed as a webpage or as a PDF.  The [`nolan_resume.xslt`](nolan_resume.xslt) file transforms the XML into HTML and the [`nolan_resume.css`](nolan_resume.css) file styles that.

### To view the rendered resume:
- User the link here: [`nolan_resume.xml`](https://cdn.rawgit.com/computersarecool/resume/master/nolan_resume.xml) and press `Ctl-p` to print as `.pdf`

### To build locally:
- Open [`nolan_resume.xml`](nolan_resume.xml) in a web browser. (You may need to run a local webserver in order to have the styling applied correctly)
- Press `Ctl-p` to print as `.pdf`
