# Resume
*My resume*

## Description
This repo contains my resume. It is meant to be displayed as a webpage or as a PDF.

## To View The Rendered Resume
- Use the link [`here`](https://willynolan.com/public/resume.pdf)

## To View The Resume Locally
- Clone the repo and open `nolan_resume.xml` in a web browser. 

Note: You may need to run a local webserver in order to have the styling applied correctly

- Press `Ctl-p` to print / save as `.pdf`

## Project Structure
- `nolan_resume.xml` contains the raw resume data
- `nolan_resume.xslt` transforms the XML into HTML 
- `nolan_resume.css` styles that

## Extra Notes
I much prefer [other data formats](https://www.json.org/) but this is written in XML because I wanted a project to use as an exercise to explore XML and XSLT.
